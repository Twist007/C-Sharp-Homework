Eclipse:

This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface is a lot cleaner 
and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework. Besides being
the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages such as
Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.

Netbeans:

The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus.
When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your 
testing environment. This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere.

gedit:

gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup. Very useful for the user 
that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects. This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.

Code::Blocks:

Unlike the other products seen thus far, Code::Blocks, which is built on the wxWidgets framework, is exceptionally 
lightweight in size, yet still quite functional and feature-rich IDE. You can load up a number of under-the-hood 
compiler engines, ranging from GCC and LLVM, to Digital Mars and Open Watcom. Code::Blocks also takes advantage of 
multi-core compiling, allowing you to get the job done faster. Code::Blocks is distributed under the GPL v3.0 license 
which means it can be used freely by anyone. 

MonoDevelop:

MonoDevelop is a free GNOME IDE designed primarily for C# and other .NET languages, but it’s open to most any language 
and has some variation in supported languages across platforms. MonoDevelop enables the rapid development of  desktop 
and ASP.NET web applications for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms, with the option to port applications created with 
Visual Studio to Max and Linux platforms, allowing for a consistent code base across platforms.
