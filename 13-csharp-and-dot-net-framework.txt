In June 2000 Microsoft released both the .NET platform and a new program language called C#. C# is a general-purpose OOP
language designed to give optimum simplicity, expansiveness, and performance. Its syntax is very similar to Java, with 
the major difference being that all variable types are derived from a common ancestor class.

C# is a language in itself. It can perform mathematical and logical operations, variable assignment and other expected 
traits of a programming language. This in itself is not flexible enough for more complex applications. At some stage, 
the developer will want to interact with the host system whether it be reading files or downloading content from the 
Internet.

The .NET framework is a toolset developed for the Windows platform to allow the developer to interact with the host 
system or any external entity whether it be another process, or another computer. The .NET platform is a Windows 
platform-specific implementation. Other operating systems have their own implementations due to the differences in the 
operating systems I/O management, security models and interfaces.
